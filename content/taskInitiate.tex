\begin{Csynopsis}
Handle taskInitiate(Observable *observable, Kernel *kernel, Objective *objective, Optimizer *optimizer)
%SP 8/4/2020: fix text wrap so it doesn't cut at odd place
\end{Csynopsis}

\begin{Cppsynopsis}
Handle qcore::taskInitiate(Observable *observable, Kernel *kernel, Objective *objective, Optimizer *optimizer)
\end{Cppsynopsis}


\begin{apiarguments}
    \apiargument{IN}{observable}{A rule that defines the basis for the measurement after the kernel has been executed on the quantum hardware}
    %SP 8/4/2020: a rule? under datatypes we say it is an operator.  
    \apiargument{IN}{kernel}{The quantum kernel to be executed as part of the objective function evaluation}
     % dosn't the ObjectiveFunction already contain the observable and kernels? See datatypes.tex
    \apiargument{IN}{objective}{A parameterized user defined function transforming input data into an output result}
    %SP 8/4/2020: how is this different from objectiveFunction?  the description is basically saying it is an objective function.  This has often confused me.
    \apiargument{IN}{optimizer}{Takes an objective function as input and outputs the optimal function parameters and associated function value}
    \apiargument{IN}{parameters}{Vector of kernel parameters}
    \apiargument{OUT}{handle}{}
\end{apiarguments}

\apidescription{
The taskInitiate call is invoked on the host to launch a quantum kernel on the quantum device. The taskInitiate call references the observable data structure, the initial quantum state, the objective function, and the classical optimizer. After a quantum kernel has been launched, host execution continues until the host reaches a sync call.  
%SP 8/4/2020: again here we are saying it references the objective function, but above the argument is 'objective'  
}

\apireturnvalues{
    Handle for the quantum kernel launched by the taskInitiate call.
}      

\apinotes{
Although from a high level of abstraction, the kernel executes on the quantum
device, with variational quantum computing, the underlying implementation may iterate         
execution between the quantum and %SP 8/4/2020: suggest 'classical host'
host devices, with the host performing classical optimization based on 
measurements from the quantum device.
