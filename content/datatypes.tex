The \qcor specification has a set of datatypes that enable the expression of quantum concepts within the \qcor \ac{API}s.\\

\subsection{\textbf{ObjectiveFunction}}\label{subsec:ObjectiveFunction}
\DATATYPENAME{ObjectiveFunction} captures the behavior of a parameterizable function. It is initialized with the problem-specific observable and kernel, and exposes a method to evaluate the kernel given a set of parameters and executes general pre and post processing of the kernel execution.\\

\subsection{\textbf{ResultsBuffer}}\label{subsec:ResultsBuffer}
\DATATYPENAME{ResultsBuffer} contains the measurement results from a single quantum execution.\\

\subsection{\textbf{Observable}}\label{subsec:Observable}
\DATATYPENAME{Observable} is an operator built from the basic operators, PauliOperator and FieldOperator. It contains the data to algebraically relate basic and complex operations, and the measurements from the observation of the kernel execution.\\

%\subsection{\textbf{PauliOperator}}\label{subsec:PauliOperator}
%\DATATYPENAME{PauliOperator} is a single operator type with three attributes: PauliX, PauliY or PauliZ, site/spatial index which is an %integer value, coefficient float value.\\

\subsection{\textbf{FieldOperator}}\label{subsec:FieldOperator}
\DATATYPENAME{FieldOperator} is a single operator type with four attributes: creator or anihilator, exchangeStatistics, site/spatial index which is an integer value, coefficient float value.\\

\subsection{\textbf{SiteMap}}\label{subsec:Sitemap}
\DATATYPENAME{SiteMap} has an integer, \VAR{site_idx}, and string, \VAR{plane}, attribute. These attributes form a mapping of \VAR{site_idx} to \VAR{plane} for use in \Clang.
